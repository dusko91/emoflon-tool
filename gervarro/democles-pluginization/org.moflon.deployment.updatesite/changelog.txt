2014-09-16	eMoflon 1.6.0 released

    New versioning scheme for eMoflon: To simplify distinguishing different versions of eMoflon, we use the following versioning scheme in the future: Version numbers are of the form X.Y.Z. Numbers X and Y denote major and minor releases, while the final number Z denotes beta releases.
    Plugin-based dependency handling: Since this version, eMoflon uses the Eclipse plugin infrastructure for dependency handling.
    This also means that you can choose freely whether to use installed plugins or whether to override them with plugin projects in the workspace.
    Arbitrary project names: Project names may now be any valid package identifier, e.g., org.moflon.utility_functions.
    New tagged values (EA): The set of possible tagged values in Enterprise Architect has been extended. All tagged values now bear the prefix Moflon::.    
    Integration of Democles pattern matcher: Improved loop detection; Introduce 'continue' statement in loops; improved validation messages
    Handbook: Visual syntax completely tested for release; textual syntax: best effort; update of all 'cheat  wizards'
2015-02-05	eMoflon 1.7.0 released

    Support for Eclipse Mars
    eMoflon builds and runs on Eclipse Mars.
    Improved handling of injections:
        Problems in injection files are now shown as error markers and will not stop the build process
        eMoflon now has a save action that automatically extracs an injection from a Java file being saved.
        To enable this feature, select Window -> Preferences -> Java/Editor/SaveActions and enable "Create Injections" under Additional Actions.
    Solved depency conflict for Apache Log4j, Commons IO, and Commons Lang
    The previous treatment of these dependencies resulted in conflicts for users that require a different version than the exported one (Opens external link in new windowIssue #374). This issue is now fixed by shipping these libraries as separate bundles.
    Improved validation error messages
    Last release with CodeGen2
    Since the previous release, eMoflon is fully bootstrapped with the Democles code generator. CodeGen2 is provided as a separate feature and support for it is not guaranteed beyond this release.
